Lily and Max loved Miss Maple’s bakery. Every Saturday, they got a sweet treat. But today, something was wrong.

“Oh no!” cried Miss Maple. “My special cupcake is missing!”

Lily looked around. The bakery was quiet. The floor was clean. But the counter had a trail of sprinkles.

Max followed the sprinkles. They led to the back door. It was open a tiny bit.

“Look!” said Max. “There’s a muddy paw print.”

Just then, Mr. Whiskers, the bakery cat, strolled by. His paws were muddy. But he just yawned and curled up in the sun.

Lily peeked outside. “Wait… what’s that?” She saw feathers near the bushes.

“Let’s check the garden!” Max said. They found a little nest. A crow sat inside, cawing softly.

Suddenly, they saw something shiny in the nest. It was the cupcake wrapper!

Lily and Max giggled. “I think we know who took the cupcake,” said Lily.

Miss Maple smiled. “You two are great detectives!”
