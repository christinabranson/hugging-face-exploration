It was a quiet morning in Willowbrook. The sun peeked over the treetops, and birds sang in the old oak trees. At the heart of town stood the Willowbrook Bakery, famous for its golden-brown pastries and sweet-smelling cinnamon rolls.

Mrs. Maple, the bakery's owner, opened the doors early every morning. Today was no different â€” except for one thing. The prize-winning blueberry pie was missing!

Mrs. Maple gasped. "Oh, my stars! I set the pie on the windowsill to cool last night. Now it's gone!"

She called Sheriff Paws, the town's clever orange tabby cat, known for solving mysteries. Sheriff Paws arrived quickly, his sharp green eyes scanning the scene.

"Let's see," Sheriff Paws said, twitching his whiskers. "The window was left open. There are crumbs on the floor and... paw prints!" He pointed to a trail of floury prints leading out the door.

"Oh dear," said Mrs. Maple. "Who could have taken my pie?"

Sheriff Paws questioned the usual suspects:

First, there was Benny the Beagle. Benny loved snacks more than anything. "I was chasing my tail at the park," Benny barked. "No time for pie!"

Next, Sheriff Paws visited Millie the Mouse. "I may be small, but I'd never eat a whole pie!" Millie squeaked. "Besides, I prefer cheese."

Finally, Sheriff Paws spoke to Gregory the Goat. Gregory was always curious and liked poking his nose where it didn't belong. "Pie? What pie? I was munching on some delicious tin cans behind the barn," Gregory bleated.

Sheriff Paws thought hard. "Benny was at the park, Millie prefers cheese, and Gregory was behind the barn... but someone left these paw prints and crumbs."

He followed the trail out of the bakery and around the corner. There, hidden behind the old oak tree, was a crumpled napkin with a single blueberry on top. Sheriff Paws sniffed the air and noticed a faint smell of pie drifting toward the schoolyard.

"Hmm... the pie thief must be close by," Sheriff Paws said.

Who took Mrs. Maple's prize-winning blueberry pie? Was it Benny, Millie, Gregory, or someone else entirely? Sheriff Paws needs your help to solve the mystery!
