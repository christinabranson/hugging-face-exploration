Ben and Mia loved helping Mr. Porter at the library. One day, Mr. Porter looked worried.

“My desk key is gone!” he said. “Without it, I can’t open the storybook drawer.”

Ben and Mia searched the library. They checked the tables, the shelves, and even under the big reading chair. No key.

“Let’s think,” said Mia. “Where was the last place you saw it?”

Mr. Porter scratched his head. “I had it this morning. I set it on my desk, right next to my teacup.”

Ben looked closely at the desk. The teacup was still there. Next to it was a puddle of water. “Your tea melted the ice in your glass,” Ben said. “But where’s the key?”

Suddenly, Mia saw something shiny in the trash can. She reached in and pulled out an empty lunch bag. “Look! The bag is crinkly and shiny — maybe the key got stuck inside!”

They checked the bag, but no key. Then Ben noticed the library cart. One wheel squeaked. Under the cart, something glimmered. “The key!” Ben shouted.

Mr. Porter smiled. “You two are amazing detectives!”
