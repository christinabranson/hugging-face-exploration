It was morning in Willowbrook. The sun was shining, and birds were singing. Mrs. Maple opened her bakery like always. But something was wrong. Her blueberry pie was missing!

"Oh no!" cried Mrs. Maple. "I left my pie on the windowsill. Now it's gone!"

She called Sheriff Paws, the town's smartest cat. Sheriff Paws looked around. "Hmm," he said. "The window is open. There are crumbs on the floor and... paw prints!"

Sheriff Paws talked to three animals:

First, Benny the Beagle. "I was playing at the park!" Benny barked. "No time for pie."

Next, Millie the Mouse. "I like cheese, not pie," Millie squeaked.

Finally, Gregory the Goat. "I was eating tin cans behind the barn," Gregory bleated.

Sheriff Paws followed the paw prints outside. Near a big tree, he found a napkin and a blueberry.

"The pie thief is close," Sheriff Paws said.

Who took the pie? Was it Benny, Millie, Gregory, or someone else? Can you solve the mystery?
